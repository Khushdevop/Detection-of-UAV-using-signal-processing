# Detection-of-UAV-using-signal-processing

Here UAV is detected by emitted radio signals and processed by extracting the features and transforming it. 

Haar transform is used.

4 files are there in Bluetooth file the preprocessing is shown and in other 3 processing on ML and DL algorithms can be seen
